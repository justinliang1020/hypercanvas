# hyperapp debugger

this is a hopefully generic hyperapp debugger

currently just used for hypercanvas, and is more logistically convenient to keep in the same repo for now

works by hooking into the [dispatch](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/hyperapp/blob/main/docs/architecture/dispatch.md) mechanism
